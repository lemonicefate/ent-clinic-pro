# Unified Calculator Architecture Implementation

## Current Status
The project is in the middle of implementing a unified calculator architecture to replace the old system. This is a major refactoring effort to make calculators more modular and maintainable.

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- **Phase 1**: Basic architecture established
  - Type system created (`src/components/calculators/types/`)
  - Registry and module loader implemented
  - Common components built
- **Phase 2**: BMI module migrated to new architecture
- **Phase 3**: eGFR and CHAâ‚‚DSâ‚‚-VASc modules migrated
- **Phase 4**: Pages updated to use new architecture
- **Testing**: Test environment fixed and running

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹
- **Legacy System Cleanup**: Some old components still exist and need careful removal
  - `src/components/common/CalculatorForm.tsx` (still used by PluginCalculator)
  - `src/components/common/CalculatorResults.tsx` (still used by PluginCalculator)  
  - `src/components/islands/PluginCalculator.tsx` (still used by professional calculators)
- **Performance Optimization**: Module loading and caching improvements
- **Documentation**: Update project README and create migration guides
- **Advanced Features**: Development tools, monitoring, and extensibility features

## Key Architecture Components
- **Registry System**: `src/components/calculators/registry/CalculatorRegistry.ts`
- **Module Loader**: `src/components/calculators/registry/ModuleLoader.ts`
- **Type System**: `src/components/calculators/types/`
- **Common Components**: `src/components/calculators/common/`

## Migration Pattern
Each calculator follows this structure:
```
src/components/calculators/modules/[calculator-name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx              # Main component
â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts             # Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts              # Type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ calculator.ts         # Calculation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ [Name]Form.tsx        # Form component
â”œâ”€â”€ [Name]Results.tsx     # Results component
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/            # Test files
```

## Testing Status
- BMI: 100% test coverage (22/22 tests pass)
- CHAâ‚‚DSâ‚‚-VASc: 100% test coverage (16/16 tests pass)
- eGFR: 80% test coverage (12/15 tests pass)

## Build Status
- Production build works with minor type warnings
- All core functionality operational
