# Calculator Architecture Refactor Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the current centralized calculator architecture into a decentralized, plugin-based system. The goal is to eliminate the bottlenecks and potential conflicts in the current `ModularCalculatorLoader` by implementing a self-registering, namespace-isolated architecture where each calculator operates independently.

**MVP Approach:** This refactor will be implemented using a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy, focusing first on solving the core problem of calculator isolation and independence, then gradually expanding functionality. The MVP will prioritize ensuring existing calculators work independently without affecting each other, while establishing a foundation for future calculator additions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Plugin-Based Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each calculator to be a self-contained plugin, so that I can develop and deploy calculators independently without modifying core system code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new calculator is created THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and load it without requiring changes to core loader code
2. WHEN a calculator plugin is removed THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally without manual cleanup of core code
3. WHEN a calculator plugin fails to load THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and continue loading other calculators
4. IF a calculator plugin has dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate and load dependencies before loading the plugin

### Requirement 2: Namespace Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want calculators to use namespaces, so that multiple calculators can have similar names without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two calculators have the same ID but different namespaces THEN both SHALL be loaded successfully
2. WHEN accessing a calculator THEN the system SHALL use the full namespaced ID (e.g., 'cardiology.cha2ds2-vasc')
3. WHEN listing calculators THEN the system SHALL group them by namespace for better organization
4. IF a namespace is not specified THEN the system SHALL assign a default namespace

### Requirement 3: Self-Registration System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want calculators to register themselves automatically, so that I don't need to manually update central configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculator module is loaded THEN it SHALL automatically register itself with the system
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL discover all calculator modules and trigger their registration
3. WHEN a calculator registers THEN the system SHALL validate its metadata and configuration
4. IF registration fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other calculators

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Discovery Mechanism

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically discover new calculators, so that deployment is simplified and doesn't require manual configuration updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL scan the calculators directory for valid calculator modules
2. WHEN a calculator directory contains required files (config.json, calculator.ts) THEN it SHALL be considered a valid calculator
3. WHEN scanning directories THEN the system SHALL handle missing or malformed files gracefully
4. IF a calculator fails validation THEN the system SHALL log the specific validation errors

### Requirement 5: Conflict Detection and Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect and prevent conflicts between calculators, so that the application remains stable when multiple calculators are deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two calculators have identical full IDs THEN the system SHALL reject the second registration and log an error
2. WHEN a calculator has dependency conflicts THEN the system SHALL prevent loading and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN version conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL use a defined resolution strategy (e.g., latest version wins)
4. IF type conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL isolate calculator types to prevent interference

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the new architecture to be backward compatible with existing calculators, so that the migration can be done gradually without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing calculators are accessed using old IDs THEN the system SHALL continue to work during the transition period
2. WHEN the old ModularCalculatorLoader is called THEN it SHALL delegate to the new system seamlessly
3. WHEN migrating calculators THEN both old and new formats SHALL be supported simultaneously
4. IF a calculator hasn't been migrated yet THEN it SHALL continue to function using the legacy system

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle calculator failures gracefully, so that one broken calculator doesn't affect the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculator fails to load THEN other calculators SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN a calculator throws an error during execution THEN the error SHALL be contained and logged
3. WHEN the system encounters invalid calculator configurations THEN it SHALL provide detailed error messages for debugging
4. IF the entire calculator system fails THEN the application SHALL degrade gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 8: Performance and Lazy Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want calculators to load quickly and efficiently, so that the application startup time is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN only calculator metadata SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN a specific calculator is requested THEN its implementation SHALL be loaded on-demand
3. WHEN multiple calculators are used THEN the system SHALL cache loaded modules efficiently
4. IF a calculator is not used THEN its resources SHALL not be loaded unnecessarily

### Requirement 9: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear interfaces and documentation for creating new calculators, so that the development process is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new calculator THEN the developer SHALL follow a standardized plugin interface
2. WHEN a calculator is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide specific validation errors
3. WHEN debugging calculator issues THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available
4. IF a calculator needs testing THEN isolated testing utilities SHALL be provided
5. WHEN developing calculators THEN hot-module replacement SHALL be supported for quick feedback
6. WHEN choosing calculator IDs THEN clear namespace conventions SHALL be documented and enforced
7. IF a developer needs to test in isolation THEN a sandbox environment SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Version Control and Compatibility Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to manage calculator plugin versions effectively, so that I can deploy updates and maintain compatibility with existing calculators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculator plugin is registered THEN its version SHALL be recorded and validated
2. WHEN multiple versions of the same calculator ID exist THEN the system SHALL use semantic versioning resolution strategy
3. WHEN a calculator plugin requires a specific version of another dependency THEN the system SHALL enforce version compatibility checks
4. IF a new version of a calculator is deployed THEN the system SHALL support rolling updates without affecting other calculators

### Requirement 11: Plugin Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear lifecycle hooks for calculator plugins, so that I can manage their initialization, updates, and cleanup effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculator plugin is loaded THEN it SHALL expose initialization and validation hooks
2. WHEN a calculator plugin is no longer needed THEN it SHALL provide cleanup/destroy hooks for resource management
3. WHEN a calculator plugin updates its configuration THEN it SHALL notify the core system through defined hooks
4. IF a plugin's lifecycle hook fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue with other plugins

### Requirement 12: UI Integration and Discovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive way to discover and access available calculators, so that I can easily find the tools I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new calculators are added THEN they SHALL automatically appear in the calculator listing, grouped by namespace
2. WHEN searching for calculators THEN the search results SHALL include namespace information and clear identification
3. WHEN a calculator has metadata or icons THEN the system SHALL display them in the listing interface
4. IF a calculator is deprecated or has issues THEN the system SHALL indicate its status in the UI

### Requirement 13: Migration Path

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a clear migration path from the old system to the new system, so that the transition is smooth and risk-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing calculators THEN a step-by-step migration guide SHALL be provided
2. WHEN both systems coexist THEN there SHALL be no conflicts or duplicate functionality
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the old system SHALL be safely removable
4. IF rollback is needed THEN the old system SHALL be easily restorable

### Requirement 14: MVP Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to implement this refactor using an MVP approach, so that we can validate the core solution quickly while minimizing risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the MVP THEN the system SHALL focus on calculator isolation and independence as the primary goal
2. WHEN the MVP is complete THEN all existing calculators SHALL work independently without affecting each other
3. WHEN a calculator fails in the MVP system THEN other calculators SHALL continue to function normally
4. IF the MVP validation is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a clear foundation for adding advanced features
5. WHEN testing the MVP THEN comprehensive isolation tests SHALL verify that calculators do not interfere with each other
6. IF performance issues arise THEN the MVP SHALL include basic performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
